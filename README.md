### Hi! :smile:

* Please, don't forget to use "npm install" to get all the dependecies! :laughing:

* To run all the tests use "npm test" :rocket:

* If you want to change some test config, open the ".testcaferc.json" file and then change it.

* To change the test speed, open the same file, then go to "speed" parameter and put it between "0.01" - "1"
